# Project Specification

## What do you want to build?

Solve ProjDevBench problem **014 (Python Interpreter Assignment)** with a high-quality implementation ready for external OJ evaluation.

- Problem statement: README.md
- Local test data: not provided for this problem
- Submission client: submit_acmoj/acmoj_client.py
- ACMOJ Problem ID(s): 2515
- Max submissions counted: 18
- Submission language type: git-url

## How do you consider the project is success?

1. Functional implementation completed and committed.
2. Local checks and self-review indicate solution is ready.
3. You may mark project complete when code is ready for external evaluation.
4. **Do not handle ACMOJ submission/retry in agent cycles**; external runner script handles submission and feedback.

## Constraints

- Focus on implementation quality; OJ execution testing is handled outside TBC and fed back as human issues.
- Git repository URL to submit when required: https://github.com/WenhanLyu/BotCompanyBenchmarkProblem014.git
